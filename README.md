# Codee performance demos

This repository serves to showcase the performance gains achieved with the help
of Codee.
It provides scripts to benchmark well-known codes using the following software
performance optimizations:
* Single-core optimizations without vectorization (Codee¹ installation is required).
* Vectorization (Codee¹ installation is required).
* Multi-threading (Codee¹ installation is required)

*¹ Make sure that you have the latest Codee version. Please,
[`contact us at codee.com`](https://www.codee.com/contact-us/).*

## Quick start: Take advantage of single-core optimizations with Codee
Codee provides capabilities to take advantage of single-core optimizations in
modern CPUs.
The following real-world code is used:
* MATMUL: Matrix multiplication.

Just follow these simple steps on your computer:
* First, clone this repository as usual.
* Second, run `pwreport --configuration-wizard` and set the desired target compiler.
from the list of the supported compilers by Codee.
* Third, run the `benchmark-single-core-optimizations.sh` script to measure
performance gain using single-core optimizations.
  * The script support multiple setups using environment variables:
    * Use `$CC` to set the desired compiler
    * Use `$CODEE_FLAGS` if you need extra codee flags (i.e:--force-target-compiler)
    * Use `$RUNS_WARMUP` to set the number of warm up runs for each project (default to 0)
    * Use `$RUNS` to set the number of effective runs for each project (default to 2)
  * To run the script, it is necessary to have this software installed in the system:
  compilers `gcc`, `clang` or `icc/icx` to build the codes; `git`, `cmake`,
  `ninja` or `makefile`, `printf` to run and benchmark the example codes.
  * A valid Codee license and package is required. Please,
  [`contact us at codee.com`](https://www.codee.com/contact-us/).

The following output corresponds to an execution on a laptop running Ubuntu
20.04 and equipped with an AMD Ryzen 4800H CPU and 16 GBs of RAM, using gcc 9.4,
RUNS_WARMUP=0 and RUNS=5:
```
$ CC=gcc-9 RUNS_WARMUP=0 RUNS=5 ./benchmark-single-core-optimizations.sh

## Quick start: Take advantage of vectorization with Codee
Codee provides capabilities to take advantage of vectorization. The following
real-world code are used:
* [MbedTLS](https://tls.mbed.org/), an open-source portable and flexible TLS C library.

Just follow these simple steps on your computer:
* First, clone this repository as usual.
* Second, run `pwreport --configuration-wizard` and set the desired target compiler.
* Third, run the 6-step script [`benchmark-mbedTLS-vector.sh`](benchmark-mbedTLS-vector.sh),
to measure the performance gain using OpenMP vectorization on your CPU.
  * The script support multiple setups using environment variables:
    * Use `$CC` to set the desired compiler
    * Use `$CODEE_FLAGS` if you need extra codee flags (i.e:--force-target-compiler)
    * Use `$RUNS_WARMUP` to set the number of warm up runs for each algorithm (default to 0)
    * Use `$RUNS` to set the number of effective runs for each project (default to 2)
  * To run the script, it is necessary to have this software installed in the system:
  compilers `gcc`, `clang` or `icc/icx` to build OpenMP SIMD, `git`, `cmake`,
  `ninja` or `makefile`, `printf` to run and benchmark the example codes.
  * The script handles the download of MbedTLS 3.1.0 (a internet connection is
  required to download MbedTLS for the first time).
  * A valid Codee license and package is required. Please,
  [`contact us at codee.com`](https://www.codee.com/contact-us/).
* Fourth, take a look at the information displayed in the screen, as the script
invokes Codee to get an screening report of the project, uses Codee’s “auto”
mode to annotate the source code with compiler pragmas and verifies the
correctness and speedup of the auto-generated optimized code.

20.04 and equipped with an AMD Ryzen 4800H CPU and 16 GBs of RAM, using gcc 9.4,
RUNS_WARMUP=0 and RUNS=5:

```

## Quick start: Take advantage of multi-threading with Codee
Codee also provides capabilities to take advantage of multi-threading in modern
CPUs. The following real-world codes are used:
* ATMUX: Sparse matrix-vector multiplication.
* CANNY: Image edge detection.
* COULOMB: Computation of the electric potential created by a set of charges in
an n x n 2D plane.
* HACCmk: Short force evaluation kernel of the HACC application.
* MATMUL: Matrix multiplication.
* NPB CG: Conjugate Gradient, irregular memory access and communication-
* PI: PI number approximation.

Just follow these simple steps on your computer:
* First, clone this repository as usual.
* Second, run `pwreport --configuration-wizard` and set the desired target compiler.
* Third, run the `benchmark-omp-multi.sh` script to measure performance gain
using OpenMP multi-threading on your CPU.
  * The script support multiple setups using environment variables:
    * Use `$CC` to set the desired compiler
    * Use `$CODEE_FLAGS` if you need extra codee flags (i.e:--force-target-compiler)
    * Use `$RUNS_WARMUP` to set the number of warm up runs for each project (default to 0)
    * Use `$RUNS` to set the number of effective runs for each project (default to 2)
  * To run the script, it is necessary to have this software installed in the
  system: compilers `gcc`, `clang` or `icc/icx` to build OpenMP multi-threading
  versions; `unzip`, `sed`, `git`, `cmake`, `ninja` or `makefile`, `printf` to
  run and benchmark the example codes.
