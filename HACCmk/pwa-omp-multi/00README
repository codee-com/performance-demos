This is an OMP scaling benchmark for the short force evaluation kernel 
of the HACC application. It is a single-node job without MPI.

The compile options are specified in correspondent Makefile. 
CFLAGS_KERNEL variable should include aggressive optimization 
options without recognition of OpenMP directives. CFLAGS_MAIN variable
should specify the least aggressive set of optimization options to
prevent optimization of the timing statement in the main program.
This variable must include the option that recognizes OpenMP directives.

The timing routine should be changed to the one appropriate for 
a platform. This benchmark uses a low level CPU clock accurate resolution
timer

long long int timebase()

Conversion from CPU cycles to seconds is performed with the help of a 
conversion coefficient "MHz", defined in main.c:16.

Submition scrips are written for Cobalt scheduler - the standard utility
used in Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. Upon submission, the number of
threads should be specified with standard OMP_NUM_THREADS env. variable. 
The benchmark reports the number of used OpenMP threads, the computation 
run time, the result of the computation, as well as self verification of the
result. The typical output for a Blue Gene/Q node was obtained with the 
provided CheckAll script. Similar results are exepected upon response.
